# StudentManagementAPI
 
A simple Springboot API with basic CRUD functions, to add, delete, update and visualize a databank of students.

Currently the API can add, update, delete and display database entries via XML interface. HTTP requests have been made through Postman.

Possible routes for improvement of the API:
- integration with a third party SQL database (postgres in my case most likely), currently using H2;
- added functionalities for student grade supervision, classes taken, year of study, overall GPA;
- a more friendly graphical interface.
